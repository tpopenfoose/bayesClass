```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Parts 5 & 6 - MCMC



```{r f35}
X_Y <- $NOR($
                                          
x_y <- function(mu, var, y) {
  
  rnorm(mu[1,1]+var[1,2]/var[2,2]*(y-mu[2,1]
  
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
